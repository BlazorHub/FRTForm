1. Document what the form should look like and how it should behave.
2. Implement basic IFormProcessor for the form.
3. Set up basic IFormSpecs implementation for the form (e.g. in FormSpecsSetup).
4. Write a test class and add the BasicTests section:
	FormSpecs_AllElements_NumberCorrect
	FormSpecs_SecondAccess_AllElementsNew
	FormSpecs_SecondAccess_ProcessorNew
	Elements_Includes_NamedElements
5. Add the required IFormElements to the IFormSpecs implementation, so that the BasicTests pass.
6. Add tests for all functionality and modify the IFormProcessor so the tests pass.
7. Add new Blazor component i.e. the form.

BasicForm
Use to demonstrate non-modal form.
Only TitleElement and ButtonElement (for Submit).
